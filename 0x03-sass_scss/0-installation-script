Steps I took to install SASS:

1. Installed Node Version Manager (NVM) to manage Node.js versions:
   $ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash

2. Exited terminal and reopened it to load NVM.

3. Installed Node.js version 20.16 using NVM:
   $ nvm install 20.16

4. Verified Node.js installation:
   $ node -v
   $ npm -v

5. Installed SASS version 3.7.4 globally using npm:
   $ npm install -g sass@3.7.4

6. Verified SASS installation:
   $ sass --version
